# School_District_Analysis

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to revisit the district's analysis of test scores after removing the results for ninth graders at Thomas High School. The revisit is the result of suspicion of academic dishonesty. The report below describes how removing the scores for this group of students affected the district's overall performance.
